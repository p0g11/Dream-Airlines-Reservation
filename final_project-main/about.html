        <p class="hero-content-text text-center">
          Dream Airlines Company (DAC) began working in the airline sector in
          March 2001 and invented the "cheap fare, great value" business model.
          Since its beginning, it has carried more than 180 million passengers.
          One of the most up-to-date aircraft fleets in the world, DAC now runs
          a fleet of 48 Airbus (seven A321neo, seven A321ceo, five A320neo, 26
          A320, seven A330, and one A330 freighter) and 21 ATR (six ATR 72-500,
          thirteen ATR 72-600, and two ATR Freighters). Dream Airlines will take
          delivery of 26 further Airbus A321neo, three additional ATR 72-600, 16
          additional A330neo, and fifteen additional A320 family aircraft
          between 2021 and 2028. In addition to its 25 foreign destinations,
          CEB's 36 local destinations build a vast network throughout the
          Philippines. Manila, Cebu, Clark, Kalibo, Iloilo, Davao, and Cagayan
          de Oro are the organization's seven strategically located centers. The
          airline continues to devise creative pricing strategies so it may
          constantly offer low year-round fares for all its flights. As it goes
          all out in its customer-first initiatives, Dream Airlines Company
          (DAC) is among the first airlines in Asia to invest in an integrated
          facility and technology for social intelligence and customer
          engagement with its Customer Command Center.

            The 24/7 command center is equipped with social monitoring,
            publishing and engagement tools—all tasked to assist travelers on
            their concerns and inquiries. In the Philippines, DAC is also the
            go-to airline for air cargo, connecting islands through trade in
            goods. It serves a wide network, including individual shippers and
            cargo agencies domestically and abroad, by offering competitive,
            quick, flexible, and uncomplicated air cargo service. Moreover, CEB
            will be the only passenger airline in the Philippines with a fleet
            of aircraft solely dedicated to carrying cargo because it
            anticipates receiving its converted freighter aircraft within the
            next year. Customers have come to expect a particularly positive
            flying experience with DAC because this airline is the only one that
            provides entertainment in the air with its "Fun Games" on board and
            its popular, well-known inflight magazine, Smile. Through the
            "Change for Good" project, passengers can also assist Filipino
            children by donating spare change while in flight. In order to
            ensure that everyone may travel safely and responsibly, CEB
            continues to apply a multi-layered approach to safety in accordance
            with international aviation regulations, earning it a COVID-19
            compliance rating of 7/7 stars from Airline Ratings. These include
            antigen testing for DAC frontliners prior to duty, contactless
            procedures, extensive cleaning and disinfection processes for all
            aircraft and facilities, and required mask and face shield use for
            both passengers and personnel. In addition to this, jet aircraft
            have 99.99% effective hospital-grade HEPA filters to prevent the
            spread of viruses.

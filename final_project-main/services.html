        include large cities such as New York, Paris, London, etc., each of

      <h3 class="places-name">1. Machu Picchu, Peru</h3>
      <img src="./assets/img/1bg.png" class="third-img" />

      <p class="text-center third-paragraph">
        Machu Picchu was further excavated in 1915 by Bingham, in 1934 by the<br />
        Peruvian archaeologist Luis E. Valcarcel, and in 1940–41 by Paul
        Fejos.<br />
        Additional discoveries throughout the Cordillera de Vilcabamba have<br />
        shown that Machu Picchu was one of a series of pucaras (fortified
        sites), <br />
        tambos (travelers’ barracks, or inns), and signal towers along<br />
        the extensive Inca foot highway.<br /><br />
        The dwellings at Machu Picchu were probably built and occupied from
        the<br />
        mid-15th to the early or mid-16th century. Machu Picchu’s
        construction<br />
        style and other evidence suggest that it was a palace complex of the<br />
        ruler Pachacuti Inca Yupanqui (reigned c. 1438–71). Several dozen<br />
        skeletons were excavated there in 1912, and, because most of those
        were<br />
        initially identified as female, Bingham suggested that Machu Picchu
        was<br />
        a sanctuary for the Virgins of the Sun (the Chosen Women), an elite
        Inca<br />
        group. Technology at the turn of the 21st-century, however, identified
        a<br />
        significant proportion of males and a great diversity in physical
        types.<br />
        Both skeletal and material remains now suggest to scholars that Machu<br />
        Picchu served as a royal retreat. The reason for the site’s
        abandonment<br />
        is also unknown, but lack of water may have been a factor.<br /><br />
        The journey to Machu Picchu typically starts in

          >the mountain city of<br />
          Cusco,</a
        >
        which was the capital city of the Inca Empire. Cusco is a<br />
        fascinating place to explore-be sure to spend a few days there before
        or<br />
        after your Machu Picchu adventure. It's possible to hike the Inca
        Trail<br />
        from Cusco to Machu Picchu. The full hike takes five days, but you
        can<br />
        also start closer and do a one-, two- or three-day hike along the
        trail.<br />
        Most people take the train from Cusco, which takes about three and a
        half hours.<br />

        is<br />
        in the U.S. state of Arizona. It's one of those beautiful places for<br />
        which photos or video just don't do it justice-its sheer size and
        scope<br />
        is hard to comprehend.<br /><br />
        With geology formed over the past two billion years, yes billion, the<br />
        277 mile-long canyon itself is believed to have been started around
        five<br />
        to six million years ago. It was formed by the flow of the Colorado<br />
        River, which still flows through it and continues to erode the
        geology<br />
        along its course. The Grand Canyon is up to 18 miles wide in places
        and<br />
        up to a mile deep. Imagine standing on the edge, looking down a sheer<br />
        rock wall almost a mile to the river below.<br /><br />

        and great overlooks are spread along the rim road, known as Desert
        View<br />
        Drive. A range of accommodations are available here and nearby, from<br />
        tents to a rustic luxury canyon-side resort built from logs. A few<br />
        accommodations are also found on the remote North Rim.<br /><br />
        Many visitors access the canyon via the historic Grand Canyon
        Railway,<br />
        which runs from the town of Williams, Arizona. The 64-mile rail line<br />
        provides an entertaining way to get to the canyon with food and live<br />
        music onboard. For those who prefer to drive, see our articles on<br />

      <p class="text-center third-paragraph">
        The Eternal City is more like a giant, living museum. Visitors are<br />
        immersed in and surrounded by thousands of years of history. It's a<br />
        relatively compact city, and a three-day itinerary gets you to the<br />
        minimum number of must-see places.<br /><br />
        These must-see sites for any visitor include the

        Take some time to explore the outskirts of Rome, too. Consider a hike<br />
        along a tomb-lined section of the Appian Way, the ancient Roman<br />
        superhighway, and a visit to one of the aqueduct ruins outside the
        city.<br /><br />

      <p class="text-center third-paragraph">
        This Hawaiian island offers a wide range of experiences for visitors.<br />
        You can surf, enjoy a meal on the beach at a five-star luxury resort
        in<br />
        Wailea, ride a horse across a dormant volcano in Haleakala National<br />
        Park, or hike through a rainforest in the West Maui Mountains. The<br />
        natural scenery is amazing-it's truly one of the most beautiful
        islands<br />
        in the world. When it comes to accommodation, there is something for<br />
        everyone here, from rustic hippie bungalow bed and breakfasts to<br />
        five-star luxury resort hotels. Wailea has all the luxury
        resorts-it's<br />
        like the beachfront Beverly Hills of Maui. If you're staying here, be<br />
        sure to venture out and spend some time in Kihei, where the locals
        hang<br />
        out.<br />

      <p class="text-center third-paragraph">
        Kenya's Masai Mara is an incredible bio-diverse area and a popular<br />
        safari destination. It's an opportunity to see the "big five" animals<br />
        (lion, leopard, rhinoceros, elephant, and Cape buffalo) all during
        one<br />
        trip or, if you're lucky, during one afternoon.<br /><br />
        The protected Masai Mara National Reserve park area is huge, over
        1,500<br />
        square kilometers of mainly grassland, extending all the way to the<br />
        Serengeti plain of Tanzania. The popular times to visit are during
        the<br />
        twice-yearly migrations, the main one being in July and August. Over
        a<br />
        million wildebeest and other animals cross the area in huge groups to
        go<br />
        from one feeding area to another. Most visitors fly into
